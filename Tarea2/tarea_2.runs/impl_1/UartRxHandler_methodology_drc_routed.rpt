2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Segs/COUNT/count_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Segs/COUNT/count_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Segs/COUNT/count_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.002 ns between CORE/MANHATTAN/Y1_carry_i_3_psbram_2_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and CORE/suma_euclediana_reg[22]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.077 ns between CORE/MANHATTAN/Y1_carry_i_3_psbram_2_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and CORE/suma_euclediana_reg[23]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.089 ns between CORE/MANHATTAN/Y1_carry_i_3_psbram_2_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and CORE/suma_euclediana_reg[24]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.101 ns between CORE/MANHATTAN/Y1_carry_i_3_psbram_2_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and CORE/suma_euclediana_reg[21]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.208 ns between CORE/MANHATTAN/Y1_carry_i_3_psbram_2_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and CORE/suma_euclediana_reg[25]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
